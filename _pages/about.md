# About me \[[CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gfp_ewX_yVNotA5ggA7l7CMtVjRXgmer/view?usp=sharing)\]

**I will join [the Department of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/) as a tenure-track assistant professor starting in Fall 2025. I am actively recruiting students at all levels (undergraduate, master's, and Ph.D.)! If you are interested in joining my research group, please read [this page](/contact/) and contact me by email.**

I am an incoming assistant professor at the Department of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University. 
I received my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California San Diego, where I was advised by [Michael Yip](https://yip.eng.ucsd.edu/).

My goal is to develop the next generation of intelligent robots that can **see, plan, move, and learn** as skilled medical professionals. 
My research tackles four fundamental challenges: 
1. How can robots **understand** medical environments? 
2. How can **medical knowledge inform** robots' movements? 
3. How can robots learn medical skills by **observing others and continuously accumulating their knowledge** over time?
4. How can the precision, dexterity, and intelligence pioneered in medical robotics create more capable robots **everywhere**?

I aim to answer these questions from the following two perspectives: 
1. The **mathematical modeling** of various medical and general knowledge and how these models empower robots with the ability to operate in complex medical environments with **precision, safety, and efficiency**
2. The seamless **integration of robotic perception, planning, control, and learning** that unlocks the full potential of autonomous agents in challenging and dynamic settings
