# About me

I am an electrical and computer engineering PhD student in the [ARCLab](https://www.ucsdarclab.com/) at University of California San Diego (UCSD). 
I am advised by [Professor Michael Yip](https://yip.eng.ucsd.edu/). 
Before joining UCSD, I received my bachelor degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, where I was advised by [Professor Li-Chen Fu](https://www.ntueeacl.com/25351235662594525480-advisor.html). 

My research interests lie in surgical robotics, surgical task automation, robotic manipulation, and robot learning. 
I am currently working on developing both learning-based and non-learning-based planning methods to automate complex surgical manipulation tasks which require dual-arm coorporation.
