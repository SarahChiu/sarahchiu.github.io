# About me \[[CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gfp_ewX_yVNotA5ggA7l7CMtVjRXgmer/view?usp=sharing)\]

I am a Ph.D. candidate in ECE at the University of California San Diego (UCSD), where I am advised by [Professor Michael Yip](https://yip.eng.ucsd.edu/). 
Before joining UCSD, I received my bachelor's degree in EE from National Taiwan University.

My research focuses on efficient, safe, and generalizable algorithms that enable autonomous medical operations, such as surgeries. 
By developing core techniques in probabilistic localization, constrained optimization, and reinforcement learning, I aim to advance robot sensing, planning, and adapting capabilities in real medical environments.

**I am currently on the academic job market!**
