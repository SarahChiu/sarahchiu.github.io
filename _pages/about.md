## About me \[[CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gfp_ewX_yVNotA5ggA7l7CMtVjRXgmer/view?usp=sharing)\]

I am an electrical and computer engineering Ph.D. student in the [ARCLab](https://www.ucsdarclab.com/) at the University of California San Diego (UCSD). 
My adviser is [Professor Michael Yip](https://yip.eng.ucsd.edu/). 
Before joining UCSD, I received my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University.

My research interests lie in surgical robotics, surgical task automation, robotic manipulation, and robot learning. I am currently developing both learning-based and non-learning-based planning methods to automate complex surgical manipulation tasks requiring dual-arm cooperation.
